<p>Howdy! I am Julia Machacek. I am originally from Shiner, Texas and currently living in College Station, Texas. 
    I am a student in 
    <a href="https://mays.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Mays Business School</a> 
    where I hope to study healthcare marketing. I am creating this website for a fun, educational assignment for ISTM 210 taught by Professor Phinney, the best professor!
    </p>
    
<p> Ever since I was little, I have always loved to garden and bake just like my grandmas taught me.
        I enjoy any outdoor activity, espcially at the beach. Spring time is my favorite season because of the wildflowers, beautiful weather, and Easter! 
        I love to travel so I am looking forward to studying abroud in the future.
        </p> 

<p>I love living in a small town rather than a big city. During the summer, I work at the 
            <a href="https://shiner.com" target="_blank"> K. Spoetzl Brewery</a>
            in Shiner, Texas. Being I work in hospitality, I am now considered a certified bartender and tour guide and I love it!
